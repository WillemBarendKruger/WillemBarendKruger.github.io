											<h3>High school</h3>
											<p>High school Rob Ferreira grew like a sprout from the old Witrivier primary school, which changed its status in 1948 to become a Junior High School. Thus, the school developed into an independent High School in 1955 with Mr. P.H. Kat as acting principal. The school building was completed in 1954 and the hostel in 1959.</p>
